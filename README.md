# WeightedGraphDS
A weighted graph data structure capable of doing common algorithms such as dijkstra shoretest path, DFS, BFS, Sollin(Boruvka),Prim MST, Kruskal MST, Eulerian path, Hamiltonian cycle Algorithms and more written in Java.

This was a project for the data structure course in my university.
